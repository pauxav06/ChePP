Current feature uses 32 king buckets and 12 piece buckets (including kings)
Accum is 1024 ans psqt is 1. Experimenting with 2 phase training psqt for ~10 epochs and then full network
The results are very good! Will try multiple phase training when implementing the mixture of experts.
Hopefully it will stabilise the accumulator and prevent it from receiving contradictory gradients from different experts
